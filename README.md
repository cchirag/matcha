# Matcha

**Matcha** is a terminal UI framework built with modern developer experience in mind. Inspired by the simplicity of React and the structure of Flutter, Matcha brings a component-based approach to building rich TUI applications in Go.

## 🚧 Status

This project is currently in **early development**. The goal is to build a minimal, composable terminal UI framework that allows developers to:

- Use components with local state
- Compose UIs declaratively
- Pass props and manage layout intuitively
- Build responsive and expressive terminal apps in Go

## 🛠️ Roadmap

The MVP is currently under construction. Initial focus areas:

- Core layout and rendering system
- Box and text components
- Component tree with props and local state
- Input handling and minimal event loop

## 🔬 Why Matcha?

- Component-first architecture
- Developer-friendly abstractions
- Designed for clarity, not complexity

Stay tuned for updates. Contributions and ideas are welcome once the core is stable.
